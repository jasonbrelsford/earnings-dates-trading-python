--- Summary of Findings ---
Based on the analysis of the cumulative portfolio value plot and total returns:
- The strategy 'Sell 2 Buy 1' achieved the highest total cumulative return (51,560,400.23).
- The strategy 'Sell 0 Buy 0' (the original strategy) achieved the lowest total cumulative return (26,740.40).

General Trends and Volatility:
- Strategies that involved selling before the earnings date ('Sell 2 Buy 1' and 'Sell 1 Buy 1') generally showed significantly higher cumulative returns compared to those selling on or after the earnings date.
- The 'Sell 2 Buy 1' and 'Sell 1 Buy 1' strategies exhibit more volatile growth, with periods of sharp increases, particularly in the later trades.
- Strategies selling on or after earnings ('Sell 0 Buy 0', 'Sell 0 Buy 1', 'Sell 1 Buy 0') show much flatter growth curves in comparison, with 'Sell 0 Buy 0' showing minimal growth.

Possible Reasons for Performance Differences:
- Selling before earnings may allow strategies to avoid potential negative price reactions that sometimes occur immediately after earnings announcements.
- Buying shortly after earnings might allow strategies to capture upward price movements if the market reacts positively to the earnings news after initial volatility settles, or if the market underreacts initially.
- The 'Sell 2 Buy 1' strategy, by selling two days before and buying one day after, seems to have best captured positive price momentum while avoiding potential pre- and immediate post-earnings price drops for this specific set of tickers and time period.

In conclusion, for the tested tickers and time frame, strategies that sell before earnings, particularly 'Sell 2 Buy 1', demonstrated substantially better performance than strategies selling on or after earnings. This suggests that avoiding the immediate post-earnings period by selling beforehand and buying shortly after may be a beneficial approach, although it introduces higher volatility.
